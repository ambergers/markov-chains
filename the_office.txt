You should get one of these.<br> No, thank you.<br> Do you even know what this is? It is a fitness orb and it has completely changed my life.<br> Forget everything you thought you knew about ab workouts.<br> Done.<br> This ab workout is specifically designed to strengthen your core.<br> Sorry.<br> It's all right.<br> Numerous health benefits, strengthens your back, better performance in sports, more enjoyable sex.<br> You're not having sex.<br> Plus, improves your reflexes.<br> See, I would have caught that.<br> Okay, you know what, how much is that? It's only 25 bucks.<br> Wow.<br> Okay.<br> (HISSING) Pam, can I see you in my office? PAM: It's performance review day, company-wide.<br> Last year, my performance review started with Michael asking me what my hopes and dreams were and it ended with him telling me he could bench press 190 pounds.<br> So, I don't really know what to expect.<br> Pam, you're trustworthy.<br> Thank you.<br> And a woman.<br> Oh, no.<br> And I want you to listen to a voicemail from my boss.<br> (BEEPING) JAN: Michael, it's Jan.<br> I guess I missed you.<br> I'll be there this afternoon for performance reviews.<br> I hope it's understood that that will be our only topic of discussion.<br> See you soon.<br> First impressions? Just off the top, I think she'll be here this afternoon.<br> MICHAEL: My boss is coming in today.<br> The lovely Jan Levinson-Gould.<br> Well, no Gould, the Gould has been Divorce.<br> The awkward part is that this is the first time we'll be seeing each other since Well MICHAEL: It was really nothing.<br> We just sort of got caught up in the moment.<br> The vulnerable divorcee gives herself to the "understanding with rugged good looks" office manager.<br> Just, she didn't want it to continue for some reason.<br> We both didn't.<br> I didn't want it.<br> We both didn't want it to continue.<br> It was not professional.<br> When people say something's mutual, it never is.<br> But this was mutual.<br> JAN: I guess I missed you.<br> "I guess I missed you.<br>" So she misses me? She missed you.<br> But then she goes on to say, "That will be our only topic of discussion.<br>" That doesn't mean anything.<br> Those are just words.<br> I have one idea of what it means.<br> Okay, yeah.<br> What? What? Well, I don't think you're gonna be very happy with this.<br> Oh, great.<br> All right, well, now I'm in a terrible mood.<br> Let's do your performance review.<br> Because she's conflicted.<br> She has to be professional, but she's fighting feelings for you.<br> Why That's great news.<br> That Why would I not like that? Just 'cause that you work together and it might be awkward.<br> Wow, wow.<br> All right, let's listen to that again.<br> JAN: Michael, it's Jan.<br> I guess I missed you.<br> Oh, hey.<br> Listen, Jim, here's a little tip for your performance review.<br> Okay.<br> Tell Michael that we should be stocking more of the double-tabbed manila file folders.<br> We don't have double-tabbed manila file folders.<br> Oh, yes, we do.<br> No, we don't.<br> Yeah, it's a new product.<br> So, you should just suggest that to him and then he'll be sure to give you a raise.<br> All right.<br> Well, I'm not asking for a raise.<br> I'm gonna actually be asking for a pay decrease.<br> That is so stupid.<br> What if he gives it to you? Then I win.<br> You know what? I am going to zone you out for the rest of today.<br> Okay.<br> I need to stay focused.<br> And I don't have to see you tomorrow or Sunday, and please don't call me, and we'll see how things go Monday.<br> (SIGHING) Stupid.<br> Wait, wait, one thing.<br> By tomorrow, you mean Saturday, right? Duh! Duh.<br> Today is Thursday, but Dwight thinks that it's Friday.<br> And that's what I'll be working on this afternoon.<br> Sometimes women say more in their pauses than they say in their words.<br> Really? Oh, yes.<br> Let's listen to it again, and this time, really listen to the pauses.<br> God, Stanley.<br> That's freaking brilliant.<br> How do you know that? Did you learn that on the streets? I'm sorry.<br> Oh, it's okay.<br> I did learn it on the streets.<br> On the ghetto, in fact.<br> No kidding.<br> It's all about my bonus.<br> Michael and Jan definitely made out.<br> Oh! Maybe more.<br> Oh, also it is Thursday, but Dwight thinks it's Friday.<br> So, keep that going.<br> Oh, yay! Good work, Stanley.<br> Great performance review! Stanley in the house, everybody! (WHOOPING) Angela, your turn.<br> ANGELA: I actually look forward to performance reviews.<br> I did the youth beauty pageant circuit and I enjoyed that quite a bit.<br> I really enjoy being judged.<br> I believe I hold up very well to even severe scrutiny.<br> Michael? Yeah? Jan's on the phone for you.<br> Angela, you were totally satisfactory this year.<br> Interesting.<br> Jan is calling me.<br> Maybe it wasn't so mutual after all.<br> Yeah? JAN: Michael Jan! Hello.<br> To what do I owe this pleasure? I'm returning your many calls.<br> Well, hello to you, too.<br> Yeah, I was just I just wanted to get some closure on what transpired between us at the meeting we had in the parking lot of the Chili's.<br> No.<br> No, we won't be discussing that, Michael.<br> The only things I wanna talk about during your performance review are your concrete ideas to improve your branch.<br> Well, surely, this review is a formality because of what happened at our meeting in the parking lot of the Chili's.<br> The review is anything but a formality, Michael.<br> And I expect you to forget anything that you think may have happened between us and exhibit completely professional behavior.<br> Been thinking about you.<br> Okay, that is an example of completely unprofessional behavior.<br> I don't see how that's unprofessional.<br> Michael? Yeah? Are the cameras in there with you, in your office? No.<br> They are not.<br> Yes, they are.<br> (PHONE CLICKING) (DIAL TONE) That's my girlfriend.<br> I heard they made out and had sex.<br> I heard they just made out.<br> That's it.<br> Well, I heard they made out and had sex.<br> Don't talk about it.<br> Office romances are nobody's business but the people involved.<br> Romances? Pam, I have ideas on a daily basis, I know I do.<br> I have a clear memory of telling people my ideas.<br> Is there any chance that you wrote any of my ideas down in a folder, like an idea folder? Sorry.<br> That's unfortunate.<br> How about the suggestion box? There's tons of ideas in there.<br> What suggestion box? The suggestion box that I put out.<br> And people could put in suggestions anonymously.<br> Maybe there's prizes.<br> Oh, yeah, I think I remember that from back when I first started.<br> Why don't you find it and then tell people to get their No, never mind.<br> I'll tell them.<br> Hello? Everybody? Yeah, attention, please.<br> Jan Levinson's coming very soon and so we're gonna have our weekly suggestion box meeting.<br> So you can all get in your constructive compliments ASAP.<br> Don't you mean constructive criticism? What did I say? You said constructive compliments.<br> That doesn't make any sense.<br> Well, Kelly, that was neither constructive nor a compliment, so maybe you should stop criticizing my English and start making some suggestions, okay? Hey, Dan, this is Jim.<br> It is about 11:15 and I wanted to know what you were up to tomorrow, which is the 15th, and that is a Saturday.<br> Saturday.<br> So just let me know what you're doing tomorrow, Saturday, for lunch.<br> Okay, talk to you soon.<br> JAN: Address this when we meet again.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, bye-bye.<br> Would you please tell Michael that I'm here? PAM: Sure.<br> Hi, Jan.<br> How are you? Hi, Michael.<br> I'm good.<br> How are you? Good to see you.<br> Nice to see you.<br> Okay.<br> Okay, why don't we just step into my office? We're gonna go in here.<br> Could we please go into your office? Yeah, right after you.<br> Apres vous.<br> (WHISPERING) No calls.<br> I'll get that.<br> Oh, thank you.<br> It's nice to see you.<br> Nice to see you, too, Michael.<br> Really? Not like that.<br> Oh, well You know, Michael, I think I need to make something clear right off the top.<br> I'm not going to discuss anything with you other than Dunder Mifflin business.<br> All right.<br> Period.<br> Do we understand each other? Absolutely.<br> I'm a little confused because first it's, like, all kissy-kissy and then it's, like, all regret because, "Oh, I regret that.<br> "But, wait, I'm still gonna call you.<br> "But we're just gonna talk business, "and I may come down there and fire you if you don't do your job.<br>" But what were we talking about when we first kissed? Business.<br> So, are you still in the middle of the performance reviews then? No, no, no.<br> I finished all that.<br> I'm very fast.<br> I'm not too fast.<br> Not like, "Wham, bam, thank you, ma'am.<br>" But I do say, "Thank you, ma'am.<br>" But I'm not like, "Wham bam.<br>" Not that there's anything wrong with "wham bam," if it's consensual.<br> We're talking about office stuff.<br> Can I ask you a question? No.<br> This is a business question.<br> It's nothing personal, I promise.<br> Fine.<br> Are you wearing a new perfume today? How is that a business question? Well, you're wearing it at the office, and It I'm sorry, no offense, but it's really sexy.<br> Please don't smell me, Michael.<br> Hey, Jim.<br> Hey.<br> How's it going? Oh, my God, did you see The Apprentice last night? Of course.<br> It's on every Thursday night, so how could I miss it? Can you believe who Trump fired? No, that was unbelievable.<br> Who? Who was it? Who did he fire? You didn't see it? No.<br> I went out and got drunk with my laser tag team last night.<br> Crap! Never go out on a Thursday night.<br> What the hell was I thinking? I don't understand (TELEPHONE RINGING) Hold on.<br> Sorry.<br> Yes, Pam.<br> PAM: Michael, it's time for the suggestion box meeting.<br> I'm kind of in the middle of something.<br> I wish you wouldn't interrupt.<br> You told me to buzz you about the suggestion box meeting when Jan was here.<br> I did not, not, not use those words.<br> I'd like to sit in on that meeting.<br> Is it happening right now? No, it's in, like, Everyone's waiting in the conference room.<br> Great.<br> Very good.<br> MICHAEL: Why are we here? Because I value your opinions.<br> Now, I know a lot of you don't think that I read your suggestions, but I do.<br> I just sift through them every week and I really look and scrutinize to see what you guys are writing.<br> So, let's just read some of these suckers, okay? All right.<br> Number one.<br> "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?" "What should we do to prepare for Y2K?" I thought you read these every week? Well, obviously, this one got stuck in the box.<br> That happens occasionally.<br> DWIGHT: It happens occasionally.<br> And, so One down! Next suggestion.<br> "We need better outreach for employees fighting depression.<br>" Okay.<br> All right, enough with the jokes.<br> Nobody in here is suffering from depression.<br> That sounds serious, Michael.<br> Oh, okay.<br> Well, yeah? Who wrote it? Tom? Tom.<br> Then, it is a joke because there's nobody in here named Tom.<br> Tom? He worked in accounting up until about a year ago.<br> Tom.<br> Oh, that guy? That guy was weird.<br> All right, next suggestion.<br> Next suggestion.<br> (MICHAEL GIBBERING) "You need to do something about your B.<br>O.<br>" "You need to do something about your B.<br>O.<br>" Okay.<br> Now, I don't know who this suggestion is meant for, but it's more of a personal suggestion.<br> And it's not an office suggestion.<br> Far be it from me to use this as a platform to embarrass anybody.<br> Aren't the suggestions meant for you? Well, Toby, if by me you are inferring that I have B.<br>O.<br>, then I would say that that is a very poor choice of words.<br> Michael, he wasn't inferring, he was implying.<br> You were inferring.<br> Was I, Creed? Okay, well, you know what I am implying is that when we're on an elevator together, I should maybe take the stairs.<br> Because talk about stank.<br> Not that I would ever say something like that in public, and I never have, and I never will.<br> I just think it's something that we should all be aware of, okay? Now that we've learned this, let's continue.<br> See, this is good.<br> We're learning and we're figuring some stuff out.<br> "You need to do something about your coffee breath.<br>" Okay, no! "You need to do something" Shut up, shut up, shut up, Dwight.<br> Okay.<br> I don't think you people are grasping the concept of the suggestion box.<br> Sometimes you talk to us real close.<br> Yeah? Is that hard for you? All right.<br> Well Well, when you have coffee breath it's hard I'll work on that.<br> Okay, let's keep going.<br> DWIGHT: Just keep it going.<br> Yup.<br> What do we have here? We have somebody's piece of gum.<br> Somebody put a piece of gum in there.<br> This is not a garbage can.<br> This is the future of our company.<br> This is not a place for gum, okay? I don't want to have to read these tomorrow.<br> Yeah.<br> Who wants to come in on a Saturday? Yeah What? All right.<br> Next suggestion.<br> "Next suggestion.<br>" "Don't" Okay, that's blank.<br> Don't Just Put it "Don't sleep with your boss.<br>" Do you think this is referring to you boning Jan? I can't I don't understand why you're so upset.<br> I can't All right, please sit down.<br> I'm going to sit over here, you're gonna sit over there.<br> Why are you Let me ask you this.<br> Please sit yourself down.<br> Let me ask you something.<br> What, Michael? Where did you get your outfit? (HARD ROCK MUSIC PLAYING ON CD PLAYER) You're gonna give me this raise.<br> I deserve this raise.<br> Yes! Yes! Yes! (SCREAMING) The least you can do is keep my salary consistent with inflation.<br> (SHOUTING) Yes! Why are you gonna give me this raise? Why? Because I'm awesome! I am awesome! I just don't understand why you have to pretend like nothing happened.<br> Because nothing did, Michael.<br> I'm not gonna say anything more about it and I would advise that you do the same.<br> Look Michael.<br> Oh, my God.<br> I'm sorry.<br> I'm interrupting.<br> Oh, God.<br> Were you guys making out? No, Dwight.<br> Come in.<br> Great.<br> What do you want, Dwight? I am ready for my performance review.<br> Okay, great.<br> Your performance has been adequate.<br> You may leave.<br> Goodbye.<br> Is this how you've been conducting all the reviews, Michael? Do you want to talk now? Good.<br> Okay, Dwight, leave.<br> Wait, I would like to discuss my raise.<br> Why on earth would we give you a raise? That is an excellent question.<br> Thank you for asking it.<br> Let me bring up one word.<br> Dedication.<br> I have never been late.<br> Also, I have never missed a day due to illness, even when I had walking pneumonia.<br> I even come in on holidays.<br> You do? How do you get in? I have a copy of your key.<br> That's a serious offense.<br> That is a serious offense.<br> Very serious.<br> As is toying with a man's heart.<br> Oh, Michael, for God's sakes.<br> I'd also further like to talk about my merits in the workplace.<br> Okay, third wheel, why don't you do that? For instance, the time I brought in deer jerky for the whole office.<br> That was deer? Gross.<br> Oh, God! DWIGHT: You liked it.<br> Did not.<br> Jan, have you ever had deer? No.<br> It's a delicacy.<br> And, you know what? It's an aphrodisiac.<br> So when we're done here, you guys could go over to the Antler Lodge, sample some deer, and talk about my raise.<br> What do you say, Jan? Okay, here's what I'm gonna do.<br> I'm gonna step outside, collect my thoughts, and I will return in about 10 minutes.<br> Okay, you just clear your head.<br> Thank you, Dwight.<br> Look, I know it's your job, I know you have to ask, but I promise you I'm not gonna discuss it with him, I'm certainly not gonna discuss it with you.<br> Do you have a light? And in conclusion, I think Lex Luther said it best when he said, "Dad, you have no idea "what I'm capable of.<br>" That's from Superman? Smallville.<br> And that is why I feel I deserve this raise.<br> PAM: Do you think Michael and Jan actually I don't really wanna picture it.<br> But thank you, Pam.<br> How do you come back from that? You don't, I don't think, come all the way back, you know.<br> Especially working together.<br> No, I mean doing that with Michael.<br> How do you come back from that as a human being? Yeah.<br> No, I don't think you can.<br> I'm heading back to New York.<br> Alan and I will conduct your performance review over the phone tomorrow.<br> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<br> Okay? Good.<br> No, no, no, come I just want to know why.<br> Michael, now is not the time or the place.<br> Okay, so you're saying that there is a different time or place that we could have this discussion? No.<br> I am saying we are never gonna have this conversation.<br> Well, okay.<br> What? Never? As in never, ever, ever? Or never as in there's still a chance? Never for me always means never, ever, ever.<br> I just want to know, from the horse's mouth, what is the dealio? You know, Michael Am I too short? Michael, it has nothing to do with your looks, okay? It's your personality.<br> I mean, you're obnoxious, and rude, and stupid, and you do have coffee breath, by the way.<br> And I don't agree about the B.<br>O.<br>, but you are very, very inconsiderate.<br> Really? Really.<br> You're You're a great guy, okay? I appreciate that, thank you.<br> And you were very sweet.<br> And you stayed up with me and talked to me and cried with me, and I appreciate that.<br> No, I didn't.<br> I was I don't cry.<br> But I just am not in a place right now where I'm looking for a relationship.<br> So, we can still work together, we can still be friends, but (ELEVATOR BELL DINGING) Okay? So my looks have nothing to do with it? Oh, God.<br> Jan is not in a place where she feels she can have a relationship right now, and it doesn't matter how great a guy I am.<br> And that is all I needed.<br> I'm good.<br> I can go home now.<br> (PHONE RINGING) Hey, it's 12:20.<br> Where the hell's Dwight? No idea.<br> "Never missed a day," my ass.<br> I'm here! I'm here! I'm here.<br> It's okay!
